Understanding Alter NLU

how we are manipulating your training data in a more efficient way.

 		
		Suppose we have an entity named "brand" which holds reference value for "lenovo" and its synonyms(inspiron etc.), the other one is "dell" and its synonyms. If in the sentence mentioned in the intent section (I WANT A INSPIRON) you have tagged a reference value with LENOVO, but a day later in the entity section you realise that inspiron is a varient of dell and you edit it to move it to this row, our code now will dynamically judge the change and update the value in the intent portion
