Building Chatbot/AI Assistant With Alter NLU
##############################################

A good quality training dataset is the most critical aspect behind building a robust and intelligent chatbot. Everything depends upon how good is the training dataset for the conversational agents to understand and respond accordingly based on the user intent and context. 

We understand that each query first has to pass through a model to revert a valid response to the user.
**To let our customers build, manage and analyse the training dataset, we developed** `Alter NLU <https://console.kontikilabs.com>`_.

`Alter NLU <https://console.kontikilabs.com>`_ is an open source tool to train AI based conversational agents powered by deep learning. It is conceptualized by developers, for developers, enabling them to build high quality dataset for chatbots belongining to any domain. 

.. note::
   Alter NLU is programmed to maximize output with relatively less training data

This guide is segregated into 2 parts -
   - Alter NLU Console, and
   - Alter NLU Engine
   
Which helps you in developing a good quality training dataset and build your NLU model for your AI based conversational agents.

Building an E-commerce Chatbot
==============================

We have made the Alter NLU console easy for you to get started and build your own chatbot training dataset.

This step-by-step guide begins with a tutorial on creating your account and adding your first chatbot dataset. We also demonstrate how to manage and analyze customized training dataset in real-time.

In this guide, for the ease of reference and explanation, we are going to use e-commerce dataset as an example that will train a chatbot for purchasing items.
