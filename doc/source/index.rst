Building Chatbot/AI Assistant with Alter NLU
##############################################

A good-quality training dataset is the most critical aspect for building a robust and intelligent chatbot. Everything depends upon the efficiency of the training dataset for conversational agents to understand and respond, based on the user intent and context. 

We understand that to revert a valid response to the user, each query has to first pass through a model.
**And, to let our customers build, manage and analyse the training dataset, we developed** `Alter NLU <https://console.kontikilabs.com>`_.

`Alter NLU <https://console.kontikilabs.com>`_ is an open source tool to train AI-based conversational agents, powered by deep learning. It is conceptualized by developers, for developers, enabling them to build high-quality dataset for chatbots of any domain. 

.. note::
   Alter NLU is programmed to maximize output with relatively less training data

This guide is segregated into 2 parts -
   - Alter NLU Console
   - Alter NLU Engine

This helps in developing a good-quality training dataset and building a NLU model for AI- based conversational agents.

Understanding Alter NLU Console
===============================

The main focus of the Alter NLU Console is to get rid of the struggles involved in building a stable and good-quality training dataset. To achieve the same, it is segregated into 3 parts:

Building an E-commerce Chatbot
==============================

We have made the Alter NLU console easy for you to get started and build your own chatbot training dataset.

This step-by-step guide begins with a tutorial on creating your account and adding your first chatbot dataset. We also demonstrate how to manage and analyze customized training dataset in real-time.

In this guide, for the ease of reference and explanation, we are going to use e-commerce dataset as an example to show how a chatbot can be trained to purchase items.
